      This article looks to discuss one of the theories as to how some of the super massive black holes came to be the sizes they are today. Black holes can only grow at a certain rate.
      As a result of this there are many super massive black holes that break the laws about what we know about them. In theory it should take millions/billions of years to grow to 
      thousands/millions of solar masses but we know that some black holes had masses of 800 million solar masses just 690 million years after the big bang. 
      The theory of the quasi-star is a possible answer to this problem.

       The theory is that proto-stars could grow to be so massive due to the conditions at the time, that they could form soemthing known as a quasi-star. A quasi-star  is an object that 
       resembles a star but instead of being powered by nuclear fusion in it's core, a quasi-star is powered by a black hole at it's core(Koberlein, 2013). The idea suggests that the proto star begins to 
       collapse into a star but it's central region is so massive that it froms a black hoel at it's centre. Usually when this occurss in normal stars the rest of the star is destroyed, 
       but this star would have been so massive that it didn't drive the rest of th layers away. The further accretion of matter into the black hole releases a significant amount of heat 
       which acts similar to the way fusion powers a star. In theory a star of at least 1 million solar masses would be required for this to occur and stabilise. For comparison the largest
       mass of any star we know of today has only about 300 solar masses(Tillman, 2023).

     There are crictal values for which a main sequence supermassive star form and a quasi-star form. The criticaal mass required is 360000000 solar masses and the accretion rate must be at 
     larger than or equal to 0.14 solar masses(Schleicher, 2013). If this is the case then a quasi-star can form. Theoretically the formation of quasi-stars is possible. There is also the requirement of extremely
     large dark matter halos which would bring together astronomically large amounts of helium gas. To conclude the reasons for these unexplained supermassive black holes is disputed but the 
     idea of the formation of quasi-stars is entirely possible and a plausible explanation. The James Webb telescope may be able to prove the existence of these giant quasi-stars as it looks back
     in time to the early years of our universe.
