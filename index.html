This article looks to discuss one of the theories as to how some of the super massive black holes came to be the sizes they are today. Black holes can only grow at
a certain rate. As a result of this there are many super massive black holes that break the laws about what we know about them. In theory 'it should take 
millions/billions of years to grow to thousands/millions of solar masses, but we know that some black holes had masses of 800 million solar masses just 690 million 
years after the big bang' (Banados,2017). The theory of the quasi-star (a star with a black hole at it's core) is a possible answer to this problem.

The theory is that proto stars could grow to be so massive due to the conditions at the time (0.1-0.5 billion years after the Big Bang) (Begelman, 2006), 
that they could form something known as a quasi-star. A quasi-star is an object that resembles a star but instead of being powered by nuclear fusion in it's core, 
a quasi-star is powered by a black hole at it's core (Koberlein, 2013). The idea suggests that the proto star begins to collapse into a star but it's central 
region is so massive that it forms a black hole at it's center. Usually when this occurs in normal stars the rest of the star is destroyed as a supernovea 
causes an enormous amount of energy to be released driving away the rest of the layers of the star. However, unlike other stars, a quasi star would 
have been so massive that it did not drive the rest of the layers away (Ball, 2011). The further accretion of matter into the black hole releases a significant amount of heat 
which acts similar to the way fusion powers a star. In theory a star of at least 1 million solar masses would be required for this to occur and stabilise.
For comparison the largest mass of any star we know of today has only about 300 solar masses (Tillman, 2023). Theoretically these quasi-stars could have been as 
large as 10 million solar masses and the radius of which could have been 800 thousand times wider than that of our Sun,380 times larger (Schleicher,2013) than the 
largest star we know of today.

          
There is the requirement of extremely large dark matter halos which would bring together astronomically large    <img src="https://briankoberlein.com/post/black-hole-sun/quasistar.png" alt="https://briankoberlein.com/post/black-hole-sun/"style="float:right;width:460px;height:345px;"> 
amounts of hydrogen gas (Wise, 2008). These conditions would allow the star to grow to the proportions 
required. The star forms as hydrogen gas is drawn together. In scenarios today when the star forms and starts 
nuclear fusion a large amount of radiation energy is released which drives away the surrounding gas 
cloud (Rosen, 2020). However, due to the hydrogen gas clouds being so large in these dark matter halos, the 
gas is not scattered and so continues to add to the mass of the star which allows the star to grow to massive 
proportions of up to 10 million solar masses. Due to the size and mass of the star the core is crushed into 
a black hole. In most instances this would produce a supernova which would destroy the star but in this 
case the star survives the supernova (Ball, 2011). When the black hole is born it keeps the same angular
momentum as that of the star, meaning matter orbits the black hole creating an accretion disk. An accretion
disk is'a structure which forms around a compact object(e.g. a white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) 
when matter flows towards it'(Oxford Reference, 2023) In these stars the pressure coming from the rest of 
the star is so large that the star pushes matter from the accretion disk into the black hole allowing it to
consume much more matter than it should be able to. The accretion disk becomes so hot and emits so much 
radiation that it counteracts the weight of the star that it is surrounded by. Over the next few million 
years the black hole star (quasi-star) is consumed from within by the black hole. The black hole consumes
more and more matter and increases in size. This heats up the star forcing it to expand even more.
Eventually the accretion disks become too powerful, and it blows the star apart leaving behind a black hole      
which could be up to 100 thousand solar masses. These black holes should take millions or even billions of years 
to get to this size and yet it happens much faster in this case. These black holes could merge with each 
other and be able to draw in enough matter to become the giants we see today.
The table below shows just a few of the supermassive black holes we know of today and their extreme masses.        (Koberlein, 2022)

There are critical values for which a main sequence supermassive star form and a quasi-star form. 'The critical protostellar mass required for a quasi star is 
360 million solar masses and the accretion rate must be larger than or equal to 0.14 solar masses'(Schleicher, 2013). The accretion rate of the black hole is
the amount of matter it is absorbing per year. If this is the case, then a quasi-star can form. Theoretically the formation of quasi-stars are possible. 
To conclude the reasons for these unexplained supermassive black holes is disputed but the idea of the formation of quasi-stars is entirely possible and a 
plausible explanation.
'The James Webb telescope may be able to prove the existence of these giant quasi-stars as it looks back in time to the early years of our universe.' (NASA, 2018).
