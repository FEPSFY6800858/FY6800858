      This article looks to discuss one of the theories as to how some of the super massive black holes came to be the sizes they are today. Black holes can only grow at a certain rate.
      As a result of this there are many super massive black holes that break the laws about what we know about them. In theory it should take millions/billions of years to grow to 
      thousands/millions of solar masses but we know that some black holes had masses of 800 million solar masses just 690 million years after the big bang(Banados,2017) . 
      The theory of the quasi-star is a possible answer to this problem.

       The theory is that proto-stars could grow to be so massive due to the conditions at the time(0.1-0.5 billion years after the Big Bang)(Begelman, 2006), that they could form soemthing known as a quasi-star. 
       A quasi-star  is an object that resembles a star but instead of being powered by nuclear fusion in it's core, a quasi-star is powered by a black hole at it's core(Koberlein, 2013). The idea suggests that 
       the proto star begins to collapse into a star but it's central region is so massive that it froms a black hole at it's centre. Usually when this occurrs in normal stars the rest of the star is destroyed, 
       but this star would have been so massive that it didn't drive the rest of the layers away. The further accretion of matter into the black hole releases a significant amount of heat 
       which acts similar to the way fusion powers a star. In theory a star of at least 1 million solar masses would be required for this to occur and stabilise. For comparison the largest
       mass of any star we know of today has only about 300 solar masses(Tillman, 2023). Theoretically these quasi-stars could have been as large as 10 million solar masses and the radius of which could have 
       been 800,000 times wider than that of our Sun, 380 times larger than the largest star we know of today (Schleicher, 2013).

       There is the requirement of extremely large dark matter halos which would bring together astronomically large amounts of hydrogen gas (Wise, 2008). These conditions would allow the star to grow to the proportions required.
       The star forms as hydrogen gas is drawn together. In scenarios today when the star forms and starts nuclear fusion a large amount of radiation energy is released which drives away the surrounding gas cloud (Rosen, 2020). 
       However, due to the hydrogen gas clouds being so large in these dark matter halos, the gas isn't scattered and so continues to add to the mass of the star which allows the star to grow to massive proportions 
       of up to 10 million solar masses. Due to the size and mass of the star the core is crushed into a black hole. In most instances this would produce a supernova which would destroy the star but in this case the star 
       survives the supernova (Ball, 2011). When the black hole is born it keeps the same angular momentum of that of the star, meaning matter obits the black hole creating an accretion disk. In these stars the pressure coming
       from the rest of the star is so large that the star pushes matter from the accretion disk into the black hole allowing it to consume much more matter than it should be able to. The accretion disk becomes so hot and emits
       so much radiation that it counter acts the weight of the star that it is surrounded by. Over the next few million years the black hole star( quasi-star) is consumed from within by the black hole. The black hole consumes more 
       and more matter and increases in size. This heats up the star forcing it to expand even more. Eventually the accretion disks become too powerful and it blows the star apart leaving behind a black hole which could be up to 
       100,000 solar masses. These black holes should take millions or even billions of years to get to this size and yet it happens much faster in this case. These black holes could merge with each other and be able to draw in enough
       matter to become the giants we see today.

     There are crictal values for which a main sequence supermassive star form and a quasi-star form. The critical mass required is 360000000 solar masses and the accretion rate must be 
     larger than or equal to 0.14 solar masses(Schleicher, 2013). If this is the case then a quasi-star can form. Theoretically the formation of quasi-stars is possible. 
     To conclude the reasons for these unexplained supermassive black holes is disputed but the idea of the formation of quasi-stars is entirely possible and a plausible explanation. 
     The James Webb telescope may be able to prove the existence of these giant quasi-stars as it looks back in time to the early years of our universe(NASA, 2018).
